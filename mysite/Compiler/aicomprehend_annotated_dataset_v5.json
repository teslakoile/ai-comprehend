It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job.\n\nOne girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. \"They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!\"\n\nAt that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!\n\nIt seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \"perfection\", and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.\n\nNo one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm.

They usually put the noodles into the boiling water and add in the MSG, together with the other things like eggs or vegetables. However, have you ever wondered if this is the correct way of cooking them?\n\nDo you know what is on the surface of the noodles? People use something like wax to cover the noodles when they make them, so that the noodles can join together nicely before they are put into the packaging. Many people enjoy eating them without thinking of this. But a report said the wax covered on the noodles was very bad for our bodies.

I'd push back hard if something didn't fit my world-view.\n\nIt's like I had to be first with an opinion -- as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn't thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.\n\nThis came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn't have to do that.\n\nAnd what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole.\n\nHis response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\n\nThis was a big moment for me.\n\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He's given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it's better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you're right.\n\nThere's also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.\n\nLearning to think first rather than react quick is a life-long pursuit. It's tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn't. But I'm really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.\n\nIf you aren't sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs' reverence(respect) for ideas:\n\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\n\nThat's deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They're barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss.\n\nThere are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people's money and 2. Dismissing an idea.\n\nDismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn't involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That's easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.\n\nSo next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it's too hard or it's too much work.\n\nThose things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.",

    "passage": "Give it five minutes\n\nI used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I'd think of a way to disagree. I'd push back hard if something didn't fit my world-view.\n\nIt's like I had to be first with an opinion -- as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn't thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.\n\nThis came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn't have to do that.\n\nAnd what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole.\n\nHis response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\n\nThis was a big moment for me.\n\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He's given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it's better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you're right.\n\nThere's also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.\n\nLearning to think first rather than react quick is a life-long pursuit. It's tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn't. But I'm really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.\n\nIf you aren't sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs' reverence(respect) for ideas:\n\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\n\nThat's deep.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\n\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back.

In these two episodes we focused on fashion and style and were honored to invite two special guests to join us in studio--Ms. Zhang Ling from Raffles-BICT International College and Alex from Esquire magazine.\n\nWhen we talk about fashion, color is absolutely crucial. A color can reflect the mood of an individual person or the spiritual temperament of entire society or age. Mrs. Zhang and Alex talked about the colors which have left the greatest impression on them. In the 1960s and 70s, blue and grey were the dominant colors at the time and people had limited choices to dress up. But fast forward to the present, you will find no difficulty in choosing from array of vivid colors in the market.\n\nWe also gave our guests a list of keywords--traditional brands, jeans, DIY, international brands, personal dress for them to choose from in order to represent the fashion of their generation. We find out that for every keyword our guest chose, there was a special story behind it. Some of the stories brought us back to old times--we even brought some vintage clothing from the 60s and 70s up on stage and invited some audience members to try them on.\n\nWhen we mention fashion, we must mention brand.

    "passage": "One of the traditions which is now a necessary part of Christmas is a that of Father Christmas, or Santa Claus. According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint by the church. (The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas). His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas.

    "passage": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\n\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\n\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed. Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\n\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\n\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\n\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\n\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\n\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\n\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.",

I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed. Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\n\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\n\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\n\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\n\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\n\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\n\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.",

    "passage": "A new study has been carried to test the role of story telling in lowering blood pressure. Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.\n\n Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier.

A total of 20,000 people worked on the building.\n\nIn 1657, Shah Jahan fell ill, and in 1658 his son Aurangzeb, imprisoned his father and seized power. Shah Jahan stayed in prison until his death in 1666. He was finally buried there with his wife he could never forget.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is definitely worth more than a single visit. As it is built with white marble stones, its character changes in different lights. It looks more beautiful at sunrise and sunset. At sunset, for example, the colour of the Taj changes from white to yellow, then to pink. As the moon rises, it turns a silvery white.\n\nTo show respect to the Taj, tourists are asked to take off their shoes during their visit.",

They may let you surf the Internet, listen to music and snap photos wherever you are... but they also turn you into a workaholic, it seems. A study suggests that, by giving you access to emails at all times, the all-singing, all-dancing mobile phone adds as much as two hours to your working day.\n\nResearchers found that Britons work an additional 460 hours a year on average as they are able to respond to emails on their mobiles. The study by technology retailer Pixmania, reveals the average UK working day is between nine and ten hours, but a further two hours is spent responding to or sending work emails, or making work calls. Almost one in ten admits spending up to three hours outside their normal working day checking work emails. Some workers confess they are on call almost 24 hours a day, with nine out of ten saying they take work emails and calls outside their normal working hours.

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time. This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small. Only certain instruments could pick them up. At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land. The people were always afraid. They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\n\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming. But an earthquake is almost always a surprise. Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other. The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\n\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals. It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming. In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day. Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned. The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen. And it did. An earthquake struck. What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\n\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help. A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull. For one week, the force grew stronger. Then it weakened suddenly. A day later, an earthquake struck.\n\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen. But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\n\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth. They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates. Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates. Under the Earth's crust, or plates, is hot rock. The plates float on top of this rock. Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust. What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen. (Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\n\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.

We mean that they're protected from too many worries and troubles, that they live in a settled home, probably surrounded by friends and family, and that they don't have to cope with the difficulties the world is full of alone.\n\nCertainly no one would say that this girl was leading a sheltered life; she's leaving home to earn her living in a strange city and live by herself in a bed sitter. She may be just as well protected physically as a \"sheltered life\" person, but she's lost all the other shelters in her life--family, friends, the home she grew up in, school, the groups she belonged to. She s on her own now and unless she's very self-reliant, she's likely to feel unhappy and insecure at times.\n\nA young person setting out on her own like this is between the two main kinds of shelter most of us spend our lives in. One is our parents home where we grow up, and the other is the home we make ourselves and where we bring up our own children. For most people the time they spend between or outside these two shelters is only a small part of their lives.",
